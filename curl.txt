curl command	Description	Example
-i or --include	Includes the response headers in the response.	
curl -i http://www.example.com

-d or --data	Includes data to post to the URL. The data needs to be url encoded. Data can also be passed in the request body.	
curl -d "data-to-post" http://www.example.com


-H or --header	Submits the request header to the resource. 
Headers are common with REST API requests because the authorization is usually included in the header.	
curl -H "key:12345" http://www.example.com

-X POST	Specifies the HTTP method to use with the request (in this example, POST). 
If you use -d in the request, curl automatically specifies a POST method. With GET requests, 
including the HTTP method is optional, because GET is the default method used.	

curl -X POST -d "resource-to-update" http://www.example.com

@filename	Loads content from a file.	
curl -X POST -d @mypet.json http://www.example.com


curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST -d "{status:MIA}" http://personsreport.com/status/person123

OR

curl -i \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -X POST \
     -d "{status:MIA}" \
     http://personsreport.com/status/person123 \
     
The Accept header tells the server that the only format we will accept in the response is JSON.
